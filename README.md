How to create a website using GitHub Pages?

These are the steps to create customizable static websites using GitHub Pages. 

Step 1: Accept the assignment we created specifically for you. After accepting it, you will notice that a repository
named 02-my-github-page-carlodb is automatically created. The repository name is structured with 02-my-github-page as the standard name for this activity, which cannot be changed, followed by carlodb, which is
your GitHub username.

Step 2: Clone the remote repository to your local machine. This will allow you to add customizable HTML static
pages with CSS. When cloning the repository, be sure to follow the proper structure to avoid issues with
pushing changes later in the lesson. Additionally, you need to configure Git in your local repository by setting
your username and email. This configuration helps track who pushes changes to the remote Git repository.

Create an index.html file in your local repository and push it to your GitHub repository. The index.html
file will be the first page rendered in the root directory of your website.

Step 3: Change the visibility of your Git repository to public, then configure GitHub Pages through the settings
by selecting which part of the branch you will use to host your static website.
